Text:  Let me show you a quiz that most people get wrong. Imagine I have a function, and there's going to be one special number where if you input it to the function, it returns true, but on all other inputs, it returns false. And let's say you know that special input is somewhere among the first n numbers. If you want to find that special value, and the only thing you're allowed to do with this function is to simply try it out on inputs, then there's really no better method than guessing and checking. On average, this would take n-half steps, and following the CS convention of disregarding constants like that one-half, people would call this a runtime of big O of n. Now, here's your quiz. For the equivalent version of this question, but in a quantum computer, where you're given a function that is in a certain sense triggered by one unique value out of the first n numbers, how many times would you have to use this mystery function to be able to find that mystery value? I threw this quiz up as a YouTube post, giving the options of O of square root of n, O of log of n, O of log of log of n, and O of 1. To be fair, without defining quantum computing or defining what this function would look like in that context, the question is not really coherent, but it's meant as a gut check. In the responses on YouTube, and also many other times that I've presented this as a live talk, the two most common answers are not correct. I just put up a full video describing how quantum computers would actually approach this problem, if you just want the answer to this quiz, you can jump to the timestamp 350. Now, I realize you're probably in a little bit more of a scroll-through-short content on your phone mood right now, but if at some point you want a half-hour explainer for the fundamentals of quantum computing, walking you through a specific algorithm, well, that full video will be there waiting for you.

Text:  I had the joy of interviewing Terence Tao about cosmic distances. For example, here's how people first learned the distance to nearby galaxies. In a galaxy, most stars, you cannot measure the brightness of a single star because there's just billions of them all crammed in the same place. But there are some amazingly bright stars, they're called cephegues. They're super giant stars that are thousands of times brighter than the sun. Some of them live in our own galaxy and some of them live in other galaxies. They still blend in, but you can still kind of measure their brightness. These stars are what are called variable stars. So most stars, they stay the same intensity for all time, but the cephegues stars, their brightness oscillates. So they have a period of intensity, like every 20 days, every 10 days, they oscillate. And it turns out that the bigger the cephegues, the brighter it is, the longer the period. If a galaxy happened to have a cephegues in it, you could observe it, work out its period, that gave you its intensity. So now you know how bright it should be, and you know how bright it looks, you can measure its distance. That gave the next rung of the ladder. So a couple thousand galaxies where you can measure the distance. But that, again, is only a tiny portion of the universe.

Text:  These days we can measure the distance to nearby planets like Venus using radar, but the way that people measure this distance for the first time in history is absolutely amazing. The basic idea here is analogous to how when your two eyes are looking at an object, based on the angle that each one of them has to turn to see it, your brain can deduce how far away that object is. For some nearby object in the sky, as you sail down to the southern hemisphere, it will appear higher up in that sky relative to say the background constellations. The angle of sight changes with position. We call this parallax. The way I'm drawing it here makes it look easy, but for the real world measurement, you have to keep in mind just how far away everything is. The nearest planet, Venus, when it is at its absolute closest to Earth, is around 39 million kilometers away, which is over 6000 times the radius of the Earth. So if this is going to work, your measurements have to be extremely precise, and you have to be absolutely sure that both observers are really looking at the same thing at the same moment. Now at the time clocks were not good enough that they could actually just say at this specific time, make this measurement. Also you're not guaranteed that you can even find the planets and so forth, but there are these transits. This is called the transit of Venus. Sometimes Venus travels along the Sun. So up in the northern hemisphere, if you're watching the transit of Venus, maybe it looks something like this, and far away at some point down in the southern hemisphere, due to parallax, Venus would appear higher up, and you essentially want to know exactly how much higher up. Now this animation is greatly exaggerating the difference. In reality, the two would look much, much more similar, more like this. And remember, there was no photography, so it's not like they could take pictures and closely compare them. Each observer would not try to directly describe where it was. Instead they would measure the duration of the transit, how long it takes from the moment that Venus's silhouette first appears on the disk to the moment that it leaves. Because if you compare those two durations, it'll tell you the ratio of lengths for these two lines across the Sun's disk. They were very close, but discernibly different. And this in turn lets you deduce the ever so slight change in viewing angle. And then like we discussed, that angle deviation can tell you how far away Venus is at that moment in terms of the distance between those observers. That is just really clever to me.
